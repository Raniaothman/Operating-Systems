An operating system (OS) is a bridge (interface) in communication connecting the user and computer hardware.Managing elements of a computer, such as disk drives, memory, printers and the central processing unit (CPU). Without an operating system, it is impossible to manage computer memory. Different data and programs are executed in memory at the same time; lack of an operating system may cause the programs to mix. The hardware components speak different languages. However, an OS speaks to all of them through device drivers. It is the drivers that make communication a success between the hardware and software
 Establishes a user interface (UI)
An operating system offers an edge connecting users and the hardware. Interface could be either a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI). In the GUI, users click elements on the screen to have interaction with the OS. For CLI, a user instructs the OS on what to do by typing a command at the command-line interface. A UI enables users to control the computers effectively they are interacting with and get feedback for effectively communicating and completing tasks.
Executing and providing services for a software application.
An OS offers a platform for a software application to function. A software application is explicit software used in carrying out specific tasks. In GUI, OS applications run under a steady graphical desktop background. An OS function is to execute all programs, both system or user programs. The OS uses different resources to run all functionalities efficiently.
