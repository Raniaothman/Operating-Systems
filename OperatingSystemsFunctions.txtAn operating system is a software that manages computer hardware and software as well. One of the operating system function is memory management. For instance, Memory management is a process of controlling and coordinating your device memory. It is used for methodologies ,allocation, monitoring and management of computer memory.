An operating system (OS) is a bridge (interface) in communication connecting the user and computer hardware.Managing elements of a computer, such as disk drives, memory, printers and the central processing unit (CPU). Without an operating system, it is impossible to manage computer memory. Different data and programs are executed in memory at the same time; lack of an operating system may cause the programs to mix. The hardware components speak different languages. However, an OS speaks to all of them through device drivers. It is the drivers that make communication a success between the hardware and software
